#Media Library
with the goal that each user does have all data from him under control we would need to store all images in the SSI

##Media Library
all Entries are available and can be picked by the user
the issue is that the image uploader or current image cropper can't access the library



##Make Media Unique and stick to one usage
for the first round we could take the media an make it somehow unique to the usage 
e.g. extend with the name + sole 
in this way we can delete the #pin if we delete or replace the image because it is not used on another place...
